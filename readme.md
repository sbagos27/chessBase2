please dont break 
it can build now.

I tried my best to follow along with the lectures, I added and used Bitboard.h. I also added Magicbitboard from Monday and used it for king moves

I added screenshots in the Screenshots file.

I added all the generator methods to generate the moves for pawns kings and knights. For some reason knights and kings cant capture so thats something ill have to look into. May I need to validate or do a check but i can move all pieces to open spaces.

my pawns can capture funny

lets say 

0000000p
P0000000

p can capture P from across the board
